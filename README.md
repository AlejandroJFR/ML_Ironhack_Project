# Renter's Union
#### Machine Learning Project by Alejandro Figueroa, Daniela Rivera, David Heller and Maya Wilson-Fernandez

## Overview
> We are a newly-formed union of renters that aim to bring transparency to rental pricing across the country. 

> This project entails creating a machine learning model that can predict the rental price of an apartment based on its features and attributes, as well as its proximity to services such as libraries, schools, and hospitals.

## Data Sources

> For this project, we used the following dataset:

[Apartment for Rent Classified](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/555/apartment+for+rent+classified)

> Datasets after cleaning and selecting:

[Clean Data with Outliers](apartment_data.csv)
[Clean Data without Outliers](filtered_apartment_data.csv)
